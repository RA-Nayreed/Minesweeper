# Minesweeper Game

A simple implementation of the classic Minesweeper game using Python and Pyglet. The game allows players to click on a grid of tiles to reveal hidden cells or flag them as potential mines.

## Features
- **Grid Layout**: The game is played on a grid where each tile may contain a mine or a number indicating how many mines are adjacent to it.
- **Flagging**: Users can flag tiles that they suspect contain mines.
- **Game Over**: If a player clicks on a tile with a mine, the game ends, and all mines are revealed.
- **Winning Condition**: The player wins when all non-mined tiles are revealed.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Pyglet: A cross-platform windowing and multimedia library
